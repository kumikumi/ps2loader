Docker usage

# start a container
docker run -d -it --name ps2dev --mount type=bind,source="/home/mikko/devaus",target=/devaus ps2dev/ps2dev:latest

# get a shell to the container
docker exec -it ps2homebrew /bin/sh
# for the first time
apk add build-base git bash patch wget zlib-dev ucl-dev cdrkit

# copying samples from container to machine
cp -r /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/samples /devaus/ps2-samples

# Install pcsx2 daily or nightly build (non-flatpak to avoid network permission issues)

# Todo: figure out networking between guest and host.
# Currently the only tested way of networking was ping from a different physical machine
# (Override dhcp ip to 192.168.2.6)

# PCSX2 networking between guest and host (needs more work):
#sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
#sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.1/24 dev tap0
#sudo ip link set dev tap0 up

# PCSX2 Settings -> Network & HDD
# Ethernet: Enabled
# Device type: PCAP Bridged
# Device: tap0
# Intercept DHCP: Enable
#  - PS2 Address: 192.168.100.2
#  - Subnet mask: auto
#  - Gateway address: 192.168.100.1
# (dns: auto / not needed)


# If pcsx2 installed with flatpak:
flatpak run net.pcsx2.PCSX2 -elf /home/mikko/devaus/ps2loader/target/ps2loader.elf
flatpak run net.pcsx2.PCSX2 /home/mikko/devaus/ps2loader/target/ps2loader.iso
